Loderunner .Net client
=========

- Register on http://codenjoy.com/codenjoy-contest (to get your name)
- Open Loderunner.sln in VS2010.
- Open file "Program.cs" from "Demo" project.
- Find line 11. It looks like:
       var game = new MyCustomAI("ApiDotNet");
- Replace "ApiDotNet" with your name, you got on step #1
- Now you can run Demo :)
- All "game logic" is in the class "MyCustomLoderunnerAI" in method "DoMove()"
